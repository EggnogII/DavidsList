Product Summary

We present DavidsList, an apartment rental web service for students. With
property taxes increasing every year, many Bay Area homeowners would like to rent out
their homes and apartments (or simply a bedroom) to students. However, it is difficult for
homeowners to make sure the students they meet on rental websites are actual students.
This is where DavidsList comes in. We provide a service where students can be verified by
their university email address, thus creating a safe and trustworthy marketplace for
landlords and students.
DavidsList provides the following features:

* Guest users can browse the website, but cannot post listings or message landlords.
* Everybody can create an account on DavidsList and everybody can read the Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy.
* Everybody is able to use search for listings. Search results may be filtered based on number of bedrooms, price, and distance to campus.
* Registered users can log in with their account info. Once logged in, they can create, edit, and delete listings. In creating a listing at least one picture of the listing must be uploaded, accompanied by a title, price, and address. Landlords are given the option to show only an approximate address on the website; this means that only the ZIP code of the listing will be shown to other users.
* Registered users seeking an apartment can communicate with the landlord of a listing by clicking on the “Contact” button on the Listing Detail page of a listing. Registered users can view and reply to messages through the All Messages page under My Account.
* Administrators can remove users and listings via Workbench.
